REACT COMPONENT LIFECYCLE:
https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

The seriesw of events that happen from the mounting of a React
component to its Unmounting.

TYPES:

1. Mounting: Birth of your component.

2. Update: Growth of your component.

3. Unmount: Death of your component.



METHODS IN REACT COMPONENT LIFE CYCLE:

1. render():

    The render() method is used to render HTML of the component in react.
    This method is required for a class based componment to render the DOM.
    It runs during the mounting and updating of your component.
    This is a PURE method which means you cannot modify the state inside it.

2. componentDidMount():

    This method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.

3. componentDidUpdate():

    The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens.
    The most common use of this method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

4. componentWillUnmount():

    The componentWillUnmount lifecycle method is called just before the component is Unmounted and destroyed.
    This is usually used to perform cleanups.
